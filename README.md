# Js\_of\_ocaml\_patches

This is a library that contains some additions to the `js_of_ocaml` standard
library. The purpose of this library is as a container for things we intend to
upstream, but that the most recent upstream release has not yet reflected.
Thus, the intention is that this library be pruned whenever there is a new
`js_of_ocaml` release.
